## 💻 Sobre

Tool in C++ to make sculptures in blocks represented by digital matrices. It allows the user to be able to create a plain text file that contains a sequence of steps to be followed to define properties of a three-dimensional matrix. The properties contain specifications for coordinates in the three-dimensional plane and color, with added transparency, for the elements. The built model can be visualized with the help of visualization software such as [GeomView](http://www.geomview.org/).


## ⚙️ Running

```bash
  $ chmod +x ./run.sh && ./run.sh

  # to directly open the file in geomeview

  $ chmod +x ./run.sh && ./run.sh --geomview trono # necessary to have geomview previously installed
```
